ANTOINE LAVOISIER: This way please, gentlemen. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Messieurs, it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system, 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that in any transformation, no amount of matter, no mass, is ever lost, and none is gained.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Over here, please. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This precise amount of water is heated 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to steam. This steam is brought into contact with a red hot iron barrel 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
embedded in the coals. From this end, we cool the steam, but, interestingly, we collect less water than 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we started with. So clearly we lose a certain amount of water. However, we also collect 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a gas, and the weight of the iron barrel increases. Now, when we combine these two increases, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have collected, they are exactly equal 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to the weight of the lost water. MEMBER OF ACADEMY: Aha! But is it atmospheric air, Monsieur Lavoisier?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
ANTOINE LAVOISIER: No, no because I am measuring it, to the very last grain, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I can see that it is lighter than the air around us, and moreover, it is flammable. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Voila. DAVID BODANIS: Water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen. So what he had done is 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
get the oxygen to stick to the inside of a red hot iron rifle barrel. He was basically 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
just making rust, which is oxygen iron, but he was making the rust really quickly. Now 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that left the hydrogen— what he called combustible "air"—and that was just floating around 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
as a gas. No mass had been lost, it had merely been transformed, and now he wanted to transform 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it all back into water. ANTOINE LAVOISIER: This is only the beginning. In the next few 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
months, I hope to demonstrate that I can recombine this combustible air with vital air and transform 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
them both back into water. I will recreate exactly the same amount of water that was 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:01.000
lost here in this process. It is my hope to complete the cycle, water into gas into water, 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and not a drop lost. DAVID BODANIS: For a long time, Lavoisier had suspected that the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
exact amount of matter, the mass, involved in any transformation was always conserved. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But to prove this he had to perform thousands of experiments, and he had to do the measurements 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
with incredible accuracy. That's where his great wealth from being a tax collector came 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in. He could afford to commission the most sensitive instruments ever built. He became 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
obsessed with accuracy. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
NARRATOR: For years the Lavoisier's burned, chopped, melted and boiled every conceivable 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
substance. They'd shown that as long as one is scrupulous about collecting all the vapors, 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
liquids and powders created in a transformation then mass is not decreased. Liquids might 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
become gases, metals may rust, wood may become ash and smoke, but matter, the tiny atoms 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that make up all substances, none of it is ever lost. The crowning glory of this opus 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
was their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
back into water.
